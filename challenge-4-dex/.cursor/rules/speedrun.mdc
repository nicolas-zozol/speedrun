Speedrun project is composed of a Hardhat project for handling smart contract, located at /packages/hardhat directory and a nextjs application located at /packages/nextjs


# console.log

Whe use hardhat, and we grep "##" to see what's happening
so we need console.log("##....) to see the message

# Error handling

Don't use require( ) version, but always :

// create errorobject


// code
if( !rule){
	console.log("## Error because ...." + ..., ...) // adapt message
	revert errorobject // adapt
}
